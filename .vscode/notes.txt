- Figure out if there is a way I can put off the file loading so that it doesn't affect navigation. Navigation still seems kind of slow the first time.
  - I might just have to do the initial asset load during the loading screen. Figure out how to do that
- Create character creation service that should act like a builder. Should have methods like withName, withExp, ...
- Modularize things. I can make better modules. By default I think I want one module that pulls things from build assets. e.x:
  - Could have one module for loading from build assets where we have:
    1. An implementation of config service that pulls a configuration file that specifies where in the buld assets things like items.json
       and perks.json can be found
    2. An implementation of assets loader that attempts to pull assets from the build assets
  - Could have another module that loads from an s3 bucket where:
    1. Config service pulls a different configuration file that has info on the s3 bucket, and where in the s3 bucket to find items.json
       and perks.json
    3. An implementation of asstes loader that attempts to pull assets from the s3 bucket.
