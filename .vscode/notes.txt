- Should try to use the item loader to load a list of items to pick from during character creation setup. Loading the items from file could be
  a background task. Would have to make sure that the items added to a players list are a deep copy of the item from a list. We wouldn't want a 
  player to consume a potion and have it consume all potions of the same type that they have equipped.
- Also I think maybe the config module should be "FileSystemConfigModule" instead. It makes slightly more sense to me that a module consists
  of services that implement interfaces that widgets might want. So if I want to build the app so it works with filesystem then I use the
  FileSystemConfigModule. If I want my configurations to be taken from an S3 bucket then I would swap it out with an S3ConfigModule which would
  have implementations for all abstract services related to configuration.
